# Aligment of photoperiodic genes and tree building 

*Written by: Laura van Rosmalen*
*January/February 2018*

Read this entire file before using the script.

Use a consistent structure for you project:
* A project directory that will include all steps of your project and the README file.
* Create subdirectories for each step of the project.
* Each subdirectory must include 3 directories: Data, Code, Results 

## Description:

## Step_1
### Purpose: Download a batch of FASTA files from NCBI and save it in a new directory.

Make a list of IDs of DNA sequences that you would like to download from NCBI.The IDs for genes can be found at the NCBI website by entering the gene name + species name. 
Save this list as a .txt file in the Data_1 directory: **~/PBfB2018/Step_1/Data_1**
In this example I will make a list with the gene "TSHb" for different rodent species and save this list as **TSHb.txt**.

Use this list as <genome_id_list> in the script **step_1.py**.

Run the python script **step_1.py** in order to download the FASTA files form NCBI

The following parts are included in this script:

Import the tool "urllib2" to be able to download files from the internet:
```python
import urllib2
```

Import the tools for file, directory and path manipulations:
```python
import os
import sys
```

Import the time tool, in order to pause the python program.
```python
import time
```

The program will ask you to enter a <genome_id_list>, this is a .txt file containing the IDs from the genes of interest that you would like to download from NCBI.
In this example we will enter: "TSHb.txt" here.
The program will ask you to define <out_dir>, define here a name of a new outputdirectory where you would like to save the FASTA files.
In this example we will enter: ~/PBfB2018/Step_1/Results_1/outTSHb

Make sure your current directory is the same diretory as where your input file is located.
So we will enter in the terminal: 
```
laura@laura-VirtualBox:~/PBfB2018/Step_1/Data_1$ step_1.py TSHb.txt ~/PBfB2018/Step_1/Results_1/outTSHb

```

The url_template is used to retrieve FASTA files from NCBI.
```python
url_template = "http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nucleotide&id=%s&rettype=fasta&retmode=text"
```

The program retrieves the FASTA file for each ID in the input list, and saves this as "ID#.fa" in the new directory. 


## Step_2
### Purpose: Combine the downloaded genes into one file named **"allgenes_genename.fa"**.

Use the command line in the terminal in order to combine the downloaded files into one FASTA file.
Save this new file in the Results_2 directory within the Step_2 directory:
```
cd ~/PBfB2018/Step_1/Data_1/outTSHb/
cat *fa > ~/PBfB2018/Step_2/Results_2/all_TSHb.fa
```

## Step_3
### Purpose: count the amount of DNA sequences, modify header names and count sequence lengths.

Run the shell script **step_3a.sh** in your terminal to count the amount of DNA sequences in your FASTA file

Run the python script **step_3b.py** in your terminal in order to determine the DNA sequence length for each ID.

Open the FASTA file in your texteditor (jEdit). Use regular expression in order to modify the header names.

Replace PREDICTED\s for nothing, in order to remove this part of the headers.

```
Search for: PREDICTED:\s
Replace with: 
```

Take a header name and define in regular expressions where to search for.

**>NM_009432.2 Mus musculus thyroid stimulating hormone, beta subunit (Tshb), transcript variant 1, mRNA**

```
Search for: (>\w+.+\d+\.\d+)\s(\w+)\s(\w+).+
Replace with:$1 $2 $3
```

This gives: **">Mus_musculus"** as new header.


Save the modified file as: **all_genename_mod.fa**

## Step_4
### Purpose: Align genes and build a tree

Use the command "clustalw" in your terminal in order to start a CLUSTAL multiple sequence alignment.

```
